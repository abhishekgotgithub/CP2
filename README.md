This project is about classifying images. If an image is fed into a machine, it will try to guess what the image is about. For example if the machine has been trained to classify among cats, dogs and birds and when an image is fed to the machine it will correctly say what the image was fed to it.

This project can be used for a variety of purposes. It can be used by govts, local authorities and private companies to see if people are wearing masks or not. For a company dealing with superstore or vending machines, the project could help them maintain the count of the stock of different brands of the same product, say for example a superstore has 3 brands of ice-cream BR, Amul and Vadilal. Each time an ice cream of a brand is picked its stock count would change real time and this will help the client maintain the stock properly.This project could also help in self driving cars in classifying the road sign and help them take proper action. This project could also help in the medical industry by helping to classify between healthy and unhealthy  cells. The potential of image classification is immense.
